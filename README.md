# Hiker's-Harvest
You play the game as a active cat or person who is known to collect/identify things on their hikes, there will be multiple different scenic hiking routes with different plants and animals in all of them. There will be a home base where you can either view the items you’ve collected or review your identification journal to see all your collectables. Some collectables will be rarer than others, and all of the items will be based on real-life plants or animals. This game is designed to be played as a cozy/relaxing experience. Although there is currently no timer or time limit for gameplay, it may be added in the future to enhance the game's interest.


If you have troubles running it, make sure to put Hiker's Harvest executable in the same folder and next to "Assets"
